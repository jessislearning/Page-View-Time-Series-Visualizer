# Page View Time Series Visualizer

This is the boilerplate for the Page View Time Series Visualizer project. Instructions for building your project can be found at https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/data-analysis-with-python-projects/page-view-time-series-visualizer


The file fcc-forum-pageview.csv contains a time series data of the freeCodeCamp forum page views.
From the CSV file, we use matplotlib and seaborn libraries to:

1. Produce a line plot of the Daily freeCodeCamp Forum Page Views 5/2016-12/2019
2. Create a bar plot of the average daily views each month, for every year available.
